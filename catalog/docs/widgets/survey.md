The survey can be added to any button by adding a data attribute (`data-role="survey-button"`) to an existing link.

`<a class="btn" data-role="survey-button" title="Hearing Loss Survey" href="#">Start Survey</a>`

If the survey is used as a global feature, you will need to add the survey widget to the main sidebar of the site, and create a global fragment with the text and button.
